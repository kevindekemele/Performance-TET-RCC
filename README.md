# Performance of TET and RCC

Nonlinear energy sinks (NES) are able to robutsly absorber vibrations of mechanical systems, through targeted energy transfer (TET) and resonance capture cascade (RCC).
This repo contains MATLAB functions which are able to compute the performance measures **pumping time**, **energy dissipation** and **cascading time** of a NES attached to vibrating main system

# Literature

The concepts of the performances were first discussed in [1] .
